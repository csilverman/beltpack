/*	UTILITIES
	=========

	These provide useful functions for writing your own mixins, as well as mixins for automating certain processes (generating responsive CSS from a map, for example). They're also used by mixins in Beltpack itself, so they should come first.
*/
/*
	As far as I can tell, there doesn't seem to be a function to get a key-value pair from a map based on index number. This might be clumsy, but it works: iterate across the map, incrementing a counter, until the counter matches the specified index, at which point you return the value.
